# Top10_Movies_FlaskApp
Flask App that displays my favorite movies of all time, the data for the movie is pulled from the TMDB API
<p>The app provides the option to Add, Edit and Delete movies to the list and based on the user rating provided during adding a movie, it is ranked automatically on the app. A synopsis and movie poster is pulled automatically from the API so that the user only needs to be concerned with their own review of the movie and rating</p>
